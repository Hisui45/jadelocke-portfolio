            As I mentioned before, my name is Jade, and I'm a <span class="emphasis">web developer</span>. I enjoy immersing myself in the world of programming, exploring various languages and creating diverse apps, websites, and digital products. To me, coding is not merely a job—it's an exhilarating adventure that allows me to transform ideas into reality through technology.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I've been programming for four years now, and during these years, I've learned that problems and obstacles are inevitable. With each obstacle and set-back, there's the opportunity for growth and innovation, and as such, <span class="emphasis">problem-solving</span> has always been a driving force behind both my learning and development. There's an indescribable thrill that comes from finding the perfect solution to a daunting challenge. It's like unlocking a treasure chest of possibilities. 
        </p>   
    
        <p>
            I want to share with you a memorable experience that exposed me to that <span class="emphasis">thrill</span> of finding innovative solutions and the <span class="emphasis">satisfaction</span> of overcoming obstacles for the first time.
            This was during my high school spring break. Early in the morning, I could smell the dew on the grass. I was excited to spend the entire day playing Minecraft. However, when I turned on my desktop, I was greeted with a blue screen.
        </p>
        <img class="blue-pic" src="img/blue screen.png">
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>What do you mean the OS system couldn't be found? </em> </span>

            <span class="emphasis"><em>It's not like it had legs to get up and walk away. </em> </span>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, at that point, I didn't fully understand what the error meant. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Simply turning the computer on and off again didn't work, and neither did any of the pre-installed recovery options. After hours of searching and trying different suggested fixes, none of which worked, I discovered that I could reinstall Windows through a USB drive. However, doing so would result in a complete wipe of the computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            That computer contained everything: pictures, videos, projects, and, most importantly, my Minecraft world save files. Needless to say, I was not inclined to go down that route. I was determined to have my cake, and eat it too. So, I kept searching for an alternative solution. Three days had passed since the blue screen appeared.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>What if I could just get the files off the computer?</em> </span>

            
        </p>

        <p>
            The hope and joy that had slowly been draining out of my body started to replenish itself. After several more hours of searching and trying numerous methods, I finally found it—a program that could be installed on a USB drive, allowing me to access my files without booting the OS.
        </p>


        <p>
            As I transfered my important files, using external drives from around the house, I've never felt more smug in my life. The battle was done. And I had won.
        </p>

        <p>
            That was six years ago, but I still approach every challenge with the same motivation, passion, and sometimes desperation, whether it involves chasing down an OS system with legs or developing websites and applications.   
        </p>

        <p>
            The lessons I learned from that challenging experience have stayed with me ever since. They have taught me the value of resilience, adaptability, and unwavering dedication. Most importantly, they have ignited a passion within me to approach every coding endeavor with a problem-solving mindset, knowing that even the most daunting challenges can be conquered with the right mix of perseverance, ingenuity, and unwavering determination.
