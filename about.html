        <p>
            As I mentioned before, my name is Jade and I'm a web developer.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Well, web developer primarily, as of right now. I enjoy developing in many languages and creating different types of apps and products. I've been programming for 4 years now. And in those years, problem-solving has always been a great motivator to learn for me. Encounter a problem, learn how to solve it. I was on spring break in high-school. Early morning, I could smell the dew on the grass. Excited to play Minecraft all day, I turn on my desktop and I'm met with a blue screen.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- <img src="img/blue screen.png"> -->
        <p>
            What do you mean the OS system couldn't be found? It's not like it had legs to get up and walk away. Of course, at this point I didn't truly understand what the error meant. Turning it on and off again didn't work, neither did any of the pre-installed recovery options. After hours of searching and trying different suggested fixes, none of which worked. I found that I could reinstall Windows through a USB drive, but doing so would completely wipe the computer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            That computer had everything. Pictures, videos, projects, and most importantly my Minecraft world save files. It goes without saying that I was not inclined to go that route. I was determined to have my cake and eat it too. So, I kept searching for an alternative solution. 3 days had passed since the blue screen made its appearance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What if I could just get the files off the computer? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Eureka! The hope and joy that had been slowly draining out of my body was replenishing itself. Several more hours of searching and trying numerous things and then I found it. A program that goes on a USB drive that can access my files without the OS booting. I grabbed every single external drive I could get my hands on. Transferring my important files, I've never felt more smug in my life. The battle was done. And I had won.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That was 6 years ago, but I still bring the same motivation, passion, (and sometimes desperation) to every challenge I face, whether it's chasing down an OS system with legs or developing websites and applications.

        <p>Oh. Right. You know my name, but I don't know yours. Let's fix that <a class="link" href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>

            Aside: As I was looking for the blue screen picture. All these articles came up about how to fix that exact issue. <br>
