            As I mentioned before, my name is Jade, and I'm a <span class="emphasis">web developer</span>. Well, primarily, at least for now. I enjoy immersing myself in the world of programming, exploring various languages and creating different types of apps, websites, and products.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I've been programming for four years now, and during these years, <span class="emphasis">problem-solving</span> has always been a great motivator for me to learn. 
        </p>   
        <br>
        <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Encounter a problem.</li>
                <li>Learn how to solve it.</li>
            </ol> 
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p>
            Simple as that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I remember a particular incident during my high school spring break. Early in the morning, I could smell the dew on the grass. I was excited to spend the entire day playing Minecraft. However, when I turned on my desktop, I was greeted with a blue screen.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="left blue-pic" src="img/blue screen.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            What do you mean the OS system couldn't be found? 
            <br>
            <br>
            It's not like it had legs to get up and walk away.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Of course, at that point, I didn't fully understand what the error meant. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Simply turning the computer on and off again didn't work, and neither did any of the pre-installed recovery options. After hours of searching and trying different suggested fixes, none of which worked, I discovered that I could reinstall Windows through a USB drive. However, doing so would result in a complete wipe of the computer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That computer contained everything: pictures, videos, projects, and, most importantly, my Minecraft world save files. Needless to say, I was not inclined to go down that route. I was determined to have my cake, and eat it too. So, I kept searching for an alternative solution. Three days had passed since the blue screen appeared.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            What if I could just get the files off the computer? 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The hope and joy that had slowly been draining out of my body started to replenish itself. After several more hours of searching and trying numerous methods, I finally found itâ€”a program that could be installed on a USB drive, allowing me to access my files without booting the OS. I grabbed every single external drive that I could get my hands on.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            As I transfered my important files, I've never felt more smug in my life. The battle was done. And I had won.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That incident was six years ago, but I still approach every challenge with the same motivation, passion, and sometimes desperation, whether it involves chasing down an OS system with legs or developing websites and applications.

            Aside: As I was looking for the blue screen picture. All these articles came up about how to fix that exact issue. <br>
